'''
To measure the correlation between a set of texts and their labels, we can follow a few common approaches in Python, such as using **TF-IDF** vectors and calculating the **correlation** between each word (or feature) and the labels. Here’s a process using TF-IDF, chi-square, and correlation metrics to check for association between text features and categorical labels.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Convert Texts to Features Using TF-IDF**: Use TF-IDF to represent each text document as a vector of term frequencies, adjusted by the inverse document frequency.

2. **Calculate Correlation**: You can use the chi-square test to measure the association between each word in the TF-IDF representation and the labels, or calculate the Pearson correlation if your labels are continuous.

Here’s an example using Python:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2
import pandas as pd

# Sample data: texts and their corresponding labels (assuming categorical labels)
texts = [
    "The movie was fantastic and thrilling",
    "A boring and slow-paced storyline",
    "Incredible performance by the lead actor",
    "The plot was uninteresting",
    "Great cinematography and music"
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  # Example labels: 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# 1. Convert texts to TF-IDF vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# 2. Calculate the chi-square correlation between each feature and the labels
chi2_scores, p_values = chi2(X_tfidf, labels)

# Map chi-square scores to feature names (words)
feature_scores = pd.DataFrame(
    {'feature': vectorizer.get_feature_names_out(), 'chi2_score': chi2_scores, 'p_value': p_values}
)

# Sort features by their chi-square scores to see which words are most associated with the labels
feature_scores = feature_scores.sort_values(by='chi2_score', ascending=False)

print("Top words associated with the labels:")
print(feature_scores.head(10))
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: `TfidfVectorizer` converts the text into a TF-IDF matrix. Each row represents a document (text), and each column represents a word (feature).

2. **Chi-Square Test**: `chi2` calculates the chi-square statistic and p-value for each feature (word) to assess its association with the label. Higher chi-square values indicate stronger associations between the feature and the label.

3. **Results**: The `feature_scores` DataFrame shows the chi-square scores and p-values, which tell us which words are most correlated with the labels.

This approach allows you to identify which words (or features) are most associated with certain classes, which can help in feature selection or understanding the predictive power of specific words in your dataset.
